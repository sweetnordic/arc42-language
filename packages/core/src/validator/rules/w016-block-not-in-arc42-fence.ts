/**
 * W016 — A :::block is not wrapped in a ```arc42 ``` fence.
 *
 * The canonical authoring convention is to wrap every :::block inside a
 * ```arc42 ... ``` fenced code block so that standard Markdown renderers
 * (GitHub, VS Code, editors) display it as a styled, bordered code block
 * instead of rendering the ::: lines as raw text.
 *
 * Diagram metadata follows the same rule as every other block: it must be
 * inside the arc42 fence before the parser can turn it into a diagram.

      rationale:
        "Standard Markdown renderers do not understand the :::type syntax and render the delimiter lines as raw text. Wrapping a :::block in ```arc42 ... ``` causes renderers to display it as a styled, bordered code block, making the document readable in GitHub, VS Code, and AI tools without changing the DSL or the parser output. Diagram metadata must also be inside the ```arc42 fence so the parser can distinguish it from prose. In AsciiDoc, write [arc42.<type>] followed by a ---- delimited body; that form is already a first-class block and does not need an extra wrapper.",
