  arc42 --help [command]

Commands:
${COMMANDS.map(([name, purpose]) => `  ${name.padEnd(9)} ${purpose}`).join("\n")}

Global options:
  --dir <path>   Workspace root (default: $ARC42_DIR or the discovered directory)
  --root <path>  Repository root for implementation paths (default: auto-detected)
  -h, --help     Show command help
  -v, --version  Show the installed version

Use arc42 <command> --help for command syntax, options, defaults, and exit behavior.

Environment:
  ARC42_DIR      Default workspace directory when --dir is not supplied

Options:
  --format <text|json|tree>  Output format (default: text)
  -h, --help                 Show this help

The command lists top-level source path segments (derived from git ls-files or the
filesystem) and shows which ones are claimed by at least one building-block or
interface element with a path field. Uncovered segments are intentional gaps —
test-only paths, tooling, or docs that are not part of the modeled architecture.

Formats:
  text  Covered and uncovered paths in flat lists with claimant IDs
  json  Full coverage result as JSON
  tree  Hierarchical tree merging covered (✓) and uncovered (✗) paths

The command always exits 0.

  --quiet               Print only errors and omit the summary
  --strict              Also exit 1 when hints are found
  -h, --help            Show this help

The command reads *.arc42.md and *.arc42.adoc files from the workspace, validates the model, and
exits 0 when it is valid. It exits 1 when errors are found and 2 for invalid command options.
`;

Usage:
  arc42 [--dir <path>] get [<id>] [options]

  --format <format>     Output format: text, json, markdown, or asciidoc (default: text)
  -h, --help            Show this help
${blockTypes ? `\nBlock types:\n  ${blockTypes.join(", ")}\n` : ""}
The command exits 0 when the requested workspace or element is found, 1 when an element
is missing, and 2 for an invalid type, format, or option.
`;

Usage:
  arc42 explain [<block-type>] [options]
  arc42 explain diagram [<type>] [options]
  arc42 explain ignore [options]

Arguments:
  <block-type>          Explain one block type; omit it to list all block types
  diagram               Explain diagram types instead of block types
  ignore                Explain the :::ignore directive syntax and constraints

Options:
  --format <text|json>  Output the explanation as text or JSON (default: text)
  -h, --help            Show this help

The command exits 0 after printing an explanation and 2 for an unknown block type or
invalid command option.
`;

Usage:
  arc42 [--dir <path>] diff [<reference>] [options]

Arguments:
  <reference>           Git revision used as the comparison base

Options:
  --staged, --cached    Compare the index with HEAD, or with <reference>
  --strict              Also exit 1 when hint findings are found
  -h, --help            Show this help

The command includes changes to *.arc42.md and *.arc42.adoc files.
Without a flag, the command compares the working tree with the index. With <reference>,
it compares the working tree with that revision. Consistency findings exit 1; set
ARC42_CONSISTENT to the displayed base commit after reviewing them. Advisory path hints do not
fail the command unless --strict is supplied. Git, parsing, and other operational errors exit 1.

Examples:
  arc42 diff                         # working tree versus index
  arc42 diff main                    # working tree versus main

  arc42 diff --cached origin/main    # index versus origin/main

Options:
  --port <number>       HTTP port (default: 3142)
  --open                Open the browser after starting the server
  -h, --help            Show this help

The server watches the selected directory recursively and refreshes the browser when
*.arc42.md or *.arc42.adoc files change. It exits 1 when the workspace or web assets cannot be
loaded.
Use --dir or ARC42_DIR to select the workspace.
`;

Usage:

  --base <url-path>     Base URL path for assets, e.g. /docs/ (default: ./)
  -h, --help            Show this help

The command reads the workspace, copies the bundled web assets to --out, and injects
the workspace data so the site works without a server. The output directory is
created if it does not exist and overwritten if it does.

It exits 0 on success, 1 when the workspace or web assets cannot be loaded, and 2
for invalid command options.

Examples:
  arc42 build --out site/docs
  arc42 --dir examples/bookstore-backend build --out site/bookstore --base /bookstore/

The command writes the twelve numbered chapter starters. Markdown files use .arc42.md;
AsciiDoc files use .arc42.adoc. Existing files are skipped. It exits 0 after writing,
and 2 for an unknown format or invalid option.

  chapter <1-12>        Print one chapter brief and its starter template
  evidence              Print the separate evidence-document format

The guide is read-only. It requires human review for gaps, assumptions, contradictions, and final
validation findings; it never automatically fixes architecture documents.
