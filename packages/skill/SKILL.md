# arc42 Language

The arc42 cli helps you to create and maintain machine-friendly, human readable architecture documents
The chapter templates and the CLI guide contain the authoring rules and chapter-specific guidance;
consult them instead of relying on remembered conventions.
Always keep interaction with the human developer high: Architecture is all about decisions and tradeoffs
so be sure to always align.

## Workflow

1. For an existing repository, start with `arc42 guide migration` and follow its review gates.
2. For a new workspace, create chapter files on demand as you reach each chapter — run
   `arc42 guide chapter <number>` first to get the brief and starter template.
3. Before authoring a chapter, run `arc42 guide chapter <number>` and read that chapter's template.
4. Inspect the current model with `arc42 get` and use `arc42 explain <type>` when a block is needed.
5. When authoring or debugging a diagram, run `arc42 explain diagram <type>` to see required fields,
   allowed notations, alias syntax, and authoring tips for that diagram type.
6. Finish with `arc42 --dir <workspace> validate` and resolve errors before continuing.
   Warnings and hints that are intentional — for example two interfaces that deliberately share an
   implementation path — can be suppressed with a single-line ignore directive placed inside any
   `arc42` fence in the affected file:

   ```arc42
   :::ignore H020 Two interfaces, same entry point — intentional split contract :::
   ```

   In AsciiDoc:

   ```asciidoc
   [arc42.ignore]
   ----
   H020 Two interfaces, same entry point — intentional split contract
   ----
   ```

   The rule code is case-insensitive. A reason is optional but recommended. One directive suppresses
   all diagnostics for that rule in the same file. Use `arc42 rules` to look up rule codes.

7. Use `arc42 --dir <workspace> coverage --format tree` to see which source directories are claimed
   by building-block or interface elements, and which are not. Uncovered paths are not errors — they
   may be tooling, tests, or documentation that is intentionally out of model scope.

The guide is read-only. Do not invent facts, silently repair contradictions, or replace human review
with validation output.

## Commands

```bash
arc42 guide migration
arc42 guide chapter <number>
arc42 get --dir <workspace>
arc42 explain <type>
arc42 explain diagram
arc42 explain diagram <type>
arc42 --dir <workspace> validate
arc42 --dir <workspace> coverage --format tree
arc42 rules
```

If `arc42` is unavailable, use `npx @doctc/arc42 ...`.
